Every card I make is kind of a work of art and takes a long time to design, trial run, and complete. People have told me I should go into it professionally, but I've seen comparable cards priced at $15 and that would not be worth the materials cost and time I put into a single card. Plus, the time, effort, and care I put into my cards is not something that I would want to sell - it's only for people I love. So, I'm up late, fingers and neck very strained from working on the card, and totally, utterly unable to sleep, despite the fact that I will have to undertake a 7 hour drive in... less than 7 hours from now.",GW950561,182,t

"Meeting up at the house of some friends today to watch nostalgic anime, play board games, eat and drink.","So, years and years ago a couple of us attended an anime convention on a university campus. One night, I heard a lot of absolutely hysterical laughter coming from the floor below my room. I went down to find a lot of people watching soft yaoi (Japanese male/male animated porn) with an alternate, comedy subtitle track. Someone had also cut audio from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas into it, and scenes from The Power Puff Girls. It was hilarious. They were giving away free copies, so I nabbed one. The original is called My Sexual Harrassment. The comedy sub is called Boku No (My) Sucky Sucky. I hauled it out of it's hiding place and we're going to watch it with some new, unsuspecting friends.

Then maybe play Dixit, or The Resistence... or finish off with Card Against Humanity, just to drag us back down into the gutter again.

After the surgery I will have 36D or DD.  In order to accomplish this task effectively, the Dr. had to put drains in my sides.  The drains have been in 9 days but will be removed today.","Drains are essential elements that are put in for many surgeries. They leave an open hole to the surgical area where excess fluid can continue to ""drain"" out as opposed to being absorbed by the body. The drains consist of long surgical tubing placed under the skin and have a bulb at the end. The bulb has a valve. During normal operation, the valve is closed on the bulb and the bulb is squeezed to create a suction. The bulbs need to be emptied and measured often. Measuring the liquid that comes out helps the Dr. determine if they can be removed.  I sure hope mine can be removed today.",Js904109,378,t

So to that end, I organised a little bowling trip. There's a place that does bowling only about a 30min bus ride away and it's something they've done before (without me; as mentioned i am a miserly twit) so I knew they'd be interested. And as an added bonus, there's a bar on-site, so I can drink enough to forget how much I inevitably lose by.","I'm not really sure how to prove that, to be honest. I can take a picture while we're there or something?",GZ394257,917,d
Continue making my patchwork quilt.,"I started making my patchwork quilt after seeing one my grandmother made when she was my age. It is absolutely stunning and really inspired me.

I’m doing it all by hand and find it very relaxing sewing in the evenings while watching TV. I’d say I’m about a third of the way there. I’ve gone for a mixture of bright colours and pastel colours, but nothing too plain like cream or white. I’m using red for the sewing as I want to see my handiwork!

By visiting the museum, we as a group are able to not only expeess our passion but to also embrace the knowledge and to fully appreciate the historical pioneering geniuses of the past.

Collectively, we have managed to raise a substantial amount of funds for transport AND to also ensure plenty of notice to enable all members to book time off, and arrange childcare cover.

As we are visiting as a group, we have negotiated a discounted price for tour - so this is an added incentive.

We really hope to inspire our next generation to appreciate the history of aviation - and hope we can involve and arrange similar plans for them in our long term vision.

Going to the Dr. to get my drains out,"Next week, I plan on spending my leisure time FINALLY getting my drains out. They itch like crazy right now. I thought, going in, that they were just going to do my top surgery, bandage me up, and then I'd go in for a couple follow-up check-ups to make sure things were healing alright. But no, I should have known better. Of course with an incision big enough to remove my entire breast on either side, there's going to be some fluid build-up while it's healing. That said, it is definitely not a comfortable thing. 
Right now, I have clear tubing coming from either incision. The tubing leads to these pod-shaped 'bottles' that collect all of the gross fluids from my surgery recovery. I've been using a stretchy ace bandage around my midsection to tuck the drainage containers into so they don't interfere with things. But, despite my best efforts, they still manage to slip around and get loose or shift and dig into my rib-cage. 
Finally, FINALLY, I get to get these things taken out. No more stinging when the tubes get pulled on, no more itching bandaging, no more nausea-inducing emptying of who-knows-what down the sink at the end of every day. All I have to do is show up at the clinic, go back to the office, lay down on the bed, and get this final weight (literally and metaphorically) off/out of my chest. ","While I have a different general physician for other unrelated issues, I spent a long time deciding on which surgeon to see for my mastectomy/top surgery. After a lot of research, I decided on Dr. Kimberly Vanderveen in Denver Colorado. I met with her multiple times before the procedure. During these meetings she explained to me exactly what she'd be doing while I was under the anesthesia. She made sure that I knew this would be an irreversible process, and that if I ever decided I wanted my breasts 'back', the only option would be implants. She also let me know that no surgery is perfect - there would be scarring afterwards that would probably never completely fade, and while she would do her best to make sure everything lined up correctly, mistakes happen. By the time I walked out of her office for the last time before going in to get the surgery done, I felt super comfortable with the whole thing. I've been waiting for this for YEARS now - I was so excited the night before my appointment that I barely slept. 
My appointment next week is on Wednesday at 11:00am at my clinic in town. I won't be seeing the same surgeon, obviously, but I've spoken to her on the phone. This is not the first time I've gone in to get my drains out - the first two times they sent me home saying that there was still too much fluid build-up under the skin for it to be safe to remove them. It's going to be so nice to have my freedom back again, even if there are still some bandages left over. ",Du717980,1282,d

I'm going to be attending a junior athletics match with my children.,"This weekend, I'll be attending a junior athletics match with my kids. My son has been practicing Taekwondo for a little over two years now, and has gotten quite competitive. This will be his first regional match, so I'm a little nervous about the size and scale of what we'll encounter, but from what I've seen at the local matches it should prove to be an interesting day. 

The matches tend to be broken out into different activities, which evaluate a number of skills. Kids are tested on basic skills (with activities like board breaking), ""forms"" (which are choreographed sequences of attacks), and sparring. At the local match, a winner was picked for each of these. I believe at the regional level, my son will be competing for an overall prize as well.

It may sound strange, but I find these matches are a great way to unwind. My daughter - my youngest child - seems to find the whole thing mesmerizing, so it's a nice way to spend time with her without chasing her, or having to worry about how charged the iPad is. My son really puts his all into these competitions and has a great attitude about it all. It's humbling for me, and really helps me unwind from all of the stress and turmoil of work.","The match is scheduled for this Saturday at 8:00am, at the Thomasville Community Centre.
