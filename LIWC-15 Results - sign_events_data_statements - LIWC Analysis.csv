I expect mayhem.,"That I have already had one birthday party for a first group of his friends who were not allowed to watch the planned film as it is rated a 12, where they played on his new table tennis table and that my biggest concern has switched from the possibility of it raining to it being too light for the screen to be visible on Friday night",gT329129,63,t,1,113,80.62,70.24,12.71,59.28,28.25,14.16,93.81,57.52,15.04,9.73,4.42,0,0,3.54,1.77,5.31,7.96,16.81,8.85,2.65,6.19,0.88,10.62,2.65,1.77,1.77,4.42,0.88,1.77,1.77,0,0,0,0,11.5,0.88,2.65,0,4.42,3.54,0,0.88,0.88,0.88,0,0.88,5.31,5.31,0,0,1.77,0,0,0,1.77,9.73,4.42,2.65,1.77,0,0.88,3.54,6.19,3.54,13.27,0.88,6.19,7.08,1.77,5.31,0.88,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.42,2.65,0.88,0,0,0,0,0.88,0,0,0,0,0
Tracking down members of a maverick branch of my family tree,"Through DNA testing, I recently became aware of a brand new branch of my family tree. One of my great grandfathers was not who he thought he was. He believed that he was the illegitimate son of a solicitor's daughter and a wealthy businessman, but he was in fact the illegitimate son of a army officer and a woman of an as yet unknown ancestry. My task over the next week (and more) is to track down more about this new branch of my family tree.","My DNA test results conclusively showed that I am not related to the family lines (solicitor and businessman) as other people in those families also had DNA tests completed; these proved that we were not related at all. My mother and first cousin have also taken DNA tests and they confirm the relationships that I found. I have since found DNA matches with members of the army officer's family, and have also linked in my family tree to theirs through civil records (birth, marriage, death records).",bu480522,64,t,1,172,69.13,75.74,57.24,47.26,24.57,18.6,86.05,52.33,16.28,11.05,6.4,0.58,0,2.91,1.16,5.23,6.98,13.95,6.4,2.91,7.56,1.74,11.05,6.4,2.91,0.58,1.16,1.74,1.16,1.16,0,0,0,0,17.44,7.56,0,1.74,4.65,12.79,6.4,1.16,0,0.58,2.33,2.91,0.58,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.21,6.4,0.58,4.07,1.16,0,7.56,2.91,0,9.3,0,4.07,5.23,3.49,3.49,3.49,1.74,0,0.58,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.21,4.07,2.91,0,0.58,0,0,0,0,1.16,3.49,0,0

The class takes place in a studio that also has pole dancing and other aerial acrobatics classes. The silks go very high so there are crash mats underneath each person's silk. The tricks where you need to do aerial inverts (going from an upright position holding onto the silks in the air to an upside-down position with your legs above your head require a lot of ab strength.

I will be going to the kingdom hearts orchestra with my little sister and best friend.,"This Friday my friend will drive over and pick me and my little sister up so we can carpool to Irving where the concert will take place. Saturday morning we will spend the first half of the day getting ready and probably fangirling over the new kingdom hearts game that's going to drop, before we head over to the venue so we can grab our seats. We don't have to worry about the tickets because we bought them as soon as they dropped about three months ago. The orchestra will be playing music from the soundtracks of all the games. Hopefully they will give an encore like the performance in California, but that was the performance that opened the tour so they might have had more energy then.   I also plan to buy a ton of merch since some of it is limited edition and sold only with the tour. My best friend actually went to the performance in Cali because people rarely tour in the part of Texas where we live, so she'll be seeing this for the second time. She told me what to save my money for and what I can get later online.","You can look up the time and place the orchestra will be performing on the 28th of July, and reference how far away it is from Irving TX.

Tomorrow morning I'll be driving 7 hours away to visit my long-distance boyfriend for his birthday.,"Tomorrow, I'll be driving 7 hours to visit my long-distance boyfriend for his birthday. Tomorrow is Saturday, but his Birthday is Wednesday, so I plan to stay until Thursday. We are pretty broke so we won't be doing anything wild or expensive, mostly just everyday activities that we aren't normally able to do like cuddling. In preparation for the trip, I burned 6 CDs today, because my aux cord is broken and I can't afford to replace my stereo at the moment. Before arriving at his apartment, I plan to swing by the store to pick up soft pretzels and beer for our reunion. His roommate, Mark, is gone for the weekend, which we are both happy about. Even during our infrequent, brief visits to each other, we rarely have very much privacy.","I am up at 3 a.m. completing this survey because I am too stressed from thinking about the drive tomorrow to sleep.

Card-making is a hobby of mine, but I take it to a level that I have not seen in any card-making instructions online. Every card I make is kind of a work of art and takes a long time to design, trial run, and complete. People have told me I should go into it professionally, but I've seen comparable cards priced at $15 and that would not be worth the materials cost and time I put into a single card. Plus, the time, effort, and care I put into my cards is not something that I would want to sell - it's only for people I love.

"Meeting up at the house of some friends today to watch nostalgic anime, play board games, eat and drink.","So, years and years ago a couple of us attended an anime convention on a university campus. One night, I heard a lot of absolutely hysterical laughter coming from the floor below my room. I went down to find a lot of people watching soft yaoi (Japanese male/male animated porn) with an alternate, comedy subtitle track. Someone had also cut audio from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas into it, and scenes from The Power Puff Girls. It was hilarious. They were giving away free copies, so I nabbed one. The original is called My Sexual Harrassment. The comedy sub is called Boku No (My) Sucky Sucky. I hauled it out of it's hiding place and we're going to watch it with some new, unsuspecting friends. Plus something better and more wholesome like Fruits Basket and Cowboy Bebop. Then maybe play Dixit, or The Resistence... or finish off with Card Against Humanity, just to drag us back down into the gutter again. There'll be junk food, take away, beer, and cocktails.","Would you like a screen grab of the FB chat organising it? Otherwise, literally none. I'm some random person behind a screen.

Jo will have just got back from a few days in France so it'll be great to hear about her trip, and to lessen the post-holiday blues for her a little bit. I'm sure we'll manage to get some food, and maybe a cheeky glass of wine as well. I have nothing else planned that day, so more than happy to see how the afternoon takes us.",Jo doesn't live in Rottingdean. But she's house sitting for a couple of weeks. In a lovely house. In a village neither her nor I know that well.

On Wednesday I attend music practice at 7:30 pm until 9pm with my church worship band.,"I arrive at music practice. Find the relevant music for that week, set up my flute and music stand and wait for everyone to arrive. Sometimes we need to change the key the music is written in to accommodate the range able to be sung by the singers. This involves pencilling in new notes over the existing music.

They leave an open hole to the surgical area where excess fluid can continue to ""drain"" out as opposed to being absorbed by the body. The drains consist of long surgical tubing placed under the skin and have a bulb at the end. The bulb has a valve. During normal operation, the valve is closed on the bulb and the bulb is squeezed to create a suction. The bulbs need to be emptied and measured often.

Me and my partner are taking my baby boy swimming for the very first time.,We are planning to take our 10 week old baby swimming for the first time next Tuesday. We will have to go in the morning as that is the public swimming hours. We probably won’t be there long because they recommend baby’s aren’t in the water too long at this age because they tire quickly.

"Spending a couple of days on my sailing boat to do some maintenance and to sail in the harbour, from Friday to Saturday.","I'll be driving to Chichester Harbour on Friday with my partner and dog, then taking our dinghy out to our boat, Kite, which is moored in Itchenor Reach. We'll spend the day doing important repairs to the fuel system (a leak is causing the engine to stop unexpectedly and at dangerous times), cleaning the boat, lounging around in the sun and walking the dog in the evening, including dinner at the local pub. We'll then spend the night on the boat on her mooring and the next day, depending on the success of the fuel line fixing, we'll either go for a little sail around the harbour, or carry on with maintenance work. Saturday afternoon we will leave the boat in our dinghy, back to Itchenor and then drive home.","I would give photos if I could!

We keep her on the A25 mooring, almost at the beginning of Itchenor Reach and opposite the entrance to the Bosham Channel. This is all part of Chichester Harbour. There are a lot of utterly beautiful keel boats here, like Swallows and Sunbeams and it's lovely to just sit on our boat and watch them glide by when they're out racing. They come so close to our boat we can virtually touch them! We spend a lot of time on our boat (and I Would like to spend more) and she requires quite a lot of maintenance, being an old boat (like me...). We are planning a cross-channel trip in August and have lots ot do to the boat before we set off for Brittany.

Buying new fruit trees to plant in the garden.,"My partner and I will be going to a number of different nurseries to buy some bare rooted fruit trees.  We have decided to plant apricots, plums, cherries and apples.  We have plenty of land, so we won't be using dwarf varieties.  The plan is to have a fully functioning orchid within 10 years.  I have prepared sites by digging in manure, compost and specific fertilisers. We will need to get different varieties of each fruit, to ensure good pollination.","I have decided on sweet cherries.

Inspecting the rotten timber over the entrance to the porch and deciding how to tackle it.,I need to get the steps or a ladder to be able to reach the affected area.

Going to my weekly yoga class on Wednesday evening from 6pm until 7pm,"My mum and I drive to the class at about 5:45pm, which is held in a local hotel by the harbour. We go downstairs into the yoga room, collect a mat and a blanket each, set this up and say hello to the other members of the group. Sometimes, my mum meets her friend at the class. The room is dark and lit by candles and fairy lights. Just after 6pm, the yoga teacher turns on some relaxing music and we begin to do some gentle poses. As the class progresses, we do some more challenging poses, such as the warrior and the tree. Towards the end of the class, the lights are dimmed further and we are told to lie down and relax for a while, trying to picture a sunset in our heads. We wrap the blankets around us at this stage as it can get cold really quickly once you start to relax. At the end of the class, we leave our mats where they were ready for the next class, thank the yoga teacher and drive home feeling really relaxed.

I am going to be playing bass guitar in a concert that will be starting tonight and running through until Wednesday.,"It has been a long time coming, but I am very excited to be playing as part of a support act in a series of summer concerts which start today and run until next Wednesday.  Although we are not part of the main act (although I am sure that we will be one day!), it is a major achievement for my band (Automation) and I to have been asked to perform as a support act.  We will be the first band on stage and, although I am very, very nervous, I am also terribly excited to have the opportunity to play bass guitar, along with my band, in front of thousands of people.","Music wasn't my first love until nearly 5 years ago, when I happened to come across a free course to begin to learn the guitar.  It was slow going to start with, but I kept at it, even through the blisters and the annoyance of trying and failing to get a riff correct again, and again...  After lots of lessons, and going through the grading process (I have now achieved Grade 8), I decided to look into joining a band.

She works from home and is quite a charitable person so she thought this would be a better way to give back than buying a kitten herself.","You can contact the cat shelter if you like, the one involved is Blue Cross Burford Rehoming Centre",Gi081310,838,d,1,100,63.83,86.43,4.8,91.14,20,19,86,54,11,10,1,0,2,5,2,1,10,11,12,6,7,1,21,7,4,0,1,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,15,0,2,5,0,10,1,2,2,2,1,4,4,3,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,6,1,2,2,2,0,7,11,0,12,0,7,6,1,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,7,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Car training with my dog,"My dog frustrates me to high heavens with how scared he is of cars/traffic in general. He barks at all kinds of moving traffic and gets so frightened of being in a car that be very occasionally poops in the car which is not nice for him and not nice for anyone else in the car, or me having to clean it. For this reason, this week I will be taking him to car training where his confidence will be built up to happily be around cars and traffic and hopefully be able to sit in the car without being frightened. According to the trainer, this course will involve confidence building exercises and ‘placing the car lower in the heirachy’.

Going swimming with my daughter,"I will be taking my 8 year old daughter swimming this Saturday.

We'll probably only be there for 2 hours at most as my daughter isn't a strong swimmer and will probably tire herself out before long. That works out fine though because the pool will start getting busy around lunchtime, and I really hate the amount of screaming from all the young kids! I have to also pick up some talcum powder before then as I've run out (I must be one of the only people left who still uses talcum powder!). It's so that we can put our swimming caps on easier.

Going bowling with my family tomorrow morning,"Everyone keeps telling me that I don't spend enough time with people. My brother especially keeps saying that I should do stuff with our parents more often since they're starting to get on a bit;- i.e. I don't necessarily know how long I have left with them and will regret it later. So to that end, I organised a little bowling trip. There's a place that does bowling only about a 30min bus ride away and it's something they've done before (without me; as mentioned i am a miserly twit) so I knew they'd be interested. And as an added bonus, there's a bar on-site, so I can drink enough to forget how much I inevitably lose by.","I'm not really sure how to prove that, to be honest.

Continue making my patchwork quilt.,"I started making my patchwork quilt after seeing one my grandmother made when she was my age. It is absolutely stunning and really inspired me. It’s also given us something to bond over as I keep asking for tips on the best way of doing certain things. She helped me source some of the fabric to get me started. I’m doing it all by hand and find it very relaxing sewing in the evenings while watching TV. I’d say I’m about a third of the way there. I’ve gone for a mixture of bright colours and pastel colours, but nothing too plain like cream or white. I’m using red for the sewing as I want to see my handiwork!

I will finish reading a book in preparation for a class.,"I need to finish reading a book in preparation for a class after the summer. The book we've been asked to read is Goethe's Faust, as we're going to be studying it when classes resume and our tutors expect us to have completed it as a background reading exercise. They've told us to read it in the original German, however it's too difficult for me to do so, therefore I'm reading a translated English copy. I need to have it finished by the end of the week to ensure I have enough time left over the summer to complete all my reading for all my other classes too.","I started reading the book (technically a play) last week and have given myself until the end of this week to finish it. I tried reading it in the original German to start with, but I felt my progress was too slow - which is why I've reverted to an English copy. That shouldn't be a problem, since I know a lot of my classmates are doing the same! However, I'm wary that it could make some of our exercises in class a little more difficult, since I imagine we'll be instructed to examine Goethe's use of the German language throughout the play. In any case, I definitely need to have it finished by the end of next week, since there is a lot of reading for me yet to complete for my other classes.",gI462443,1076,d,1,242,78.47,38.61,61.34,40.65,26.89,18.6,92.56,59.09,17.77,11.57,8.26,2.89,0,0,0.41,6.2,9.5,18.18,10.33,4.96,4.13,0.41,22.31,4.55,2.07,1.24,0,2.89,3.31,2.07,1.24,0,0,0,4.96,0,0.41,0,0,13.64,1.65,2.89,2.89,1.65,2.48,2.07,0.41,0,0,0.41,0.83,0,0.83,0,0,5.37,2.89,0.83,0.41,0,1.24,5.79,10.33,1.65,13.64,0.83,3.31,9.92,6.2,2.89,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.22,3.31,3.72,0,0,0,0.41,0.41,0,4.55,0.83,0,0

Taking my daughter to the beach to swim in the sea,"In the next week I plan to visit the sea side with my little girl, Jess. Her birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks and what with this amazing weather we have been having, I thought it would be a great way to surprise her and make the most of summer at the same time! She adores putting on her jelly shoes and paddling in the sea - funny though, as she has this intense fear of fish touching her, so I will try to sneak up on her and make her jump.

If she is really good on the train down, she may even get an ice cream after her fish and chips.","My daughter Jess is the only child I have with my wife, Clare. She was born via c-section three years ago and, other than that slight complication at birth, has been nothing but a picture of health. I studied Zoology at university, so I'm always chatting about animals; I think this has passed onto her as she loves all creatures great and small. She has a funny fear of fish brushing against her in the sea, but loves to watch them swim around.

Explore Paris with my Boyfriend over the weekend when he is coming to visit.,"My boyfriend is coming to visit me as we both have a rare weekend off work at the same time and I have planned a secret getaway for the two of us to Paris, he thinks that we are going to spend the weekend in London but when we arrive I have planned to catch the Eurostar directly to Paris where I have an itinerary planned for the two of us.
On Friday we are going to arrive at around 13:30  and check straight into the hotel to relax for a few hours until our dinner reservation and show at the moulin rouge show.
On Saturday I have planned to take in the sights with my boyfriend including the Eiffel tower, Notre-dame de Paris, Arch de Triomphe and time permitting The Louvre, hopefully finding a quaint cafe / restaurant to have lunch during the day.
on Saturday evening  we dont have dinner plans due to not knowing what time we will be finished with all of the sights so we will hopefully manage to be able to find a restaurant that is not fully booked to have something to eat and enjoy some local wine. 
on Sunday we will be taking a light breakfast then we have to check out of the hotel at 11:30 and travel to the Eurostar ready to depart Paris at 13:00.",The information I have provided within my plans is detailed and specific and I have included details that I would not have known had I not have actually planned it.,LA516912,1217,d,1,258,84.76,59.18,83.08,62.52,43,15.12,90.7,56.98,12.02,9.69,4.65,4.65,0,0.39,0,2.33,8.53,17.83,10.47,3.1,5.43,1.94,17.05,2.71,0.78,1.16,3.1,1.55,1.94,1.94,0,0,0,0,6.59,0,0.78,0,1.16,8.53,2.71,0.39,1.16,1.55,1.16,2.33,1.94,1.94,0,0,3.88,0.39,0,0,3.49,10.47,5.43,3.49,0.78,0.78,0,1.94,12.02,4.26,18.6,3.49,8.53,6.59,1.16,4.26,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5.81,2.33,1.55,1.16,0,0,0,0.39,0,0,0,0.39,0

Worried about the heat, we thought it may be best to go to an event indoors. After careful planning and thought, we decided to go see a comedian we both really liked.

Visiting an airshow museum,"I will be visiting the museum as I am a member of a Facebook group who have a common interest in historical aviation and how it has evolved.

By visiting the museum, we as a group are able to not only expeess our passion but to also embrace the knowledge and to fully appreciate the historical pioneering geniuses of the past. This can only be appeeciated by seeing industrial geniuses and their machinery that are exhibited to people who share this passion.","This group event has taken a considerable time to organise - the main problem being the travelling involved. 

Collectively, we have managed to raise a substantial amount of funds for transport AND to also ensure plenty of notice to enable all members to book time off, and arrange childcare cover.

As we are visiting as a group, we have negotiated a discounted price for tour - so this is an added incentive.

We really hope to inspire our next generation to appreciate the history of aviation - and hope we can involve and arrange similar plans for them in our long term vision.",Mf056719,1233,d,1,182,79.65,95.55,15.2,96.55,26,24.73,86.26,54.4,11.54,7.14,1.1,4.95,0,0,1.1,4.4,9.34,15.38,8.79,4.4,8.79,0.55,12.64,3.85,2.75,1.65,0,4.4,6.04,5.49,0.55,0,0,0,15.38,0,0,0,0,7.69,2.75,1.1,1.65,1.1,0.55,1.65,0.55,0.55,0,0,1.1,0,0,1.1,0,13.74,9.34,2.2,0.55,1.1,0.55,2.2,9.89,2.2,10.99,2.2,2.75,5.49,2.2,2.2,0,1.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.69,3.85,2.2,0,0,0,0,1.65,0,0,0,0,0

By the end of the evening we try to get three artists that we'd like to contact to see if they are interested in a gig.","Difficult to answer, but you're welcome to join us, or come along to one of our pub nights when we get to see live music that we've found! As an example, we've had artists that have gone on to compete in the BBC's ""Young Folk Musician"" competition, so it is usually a good evening out.",fP615029,1245,d,1,163,68.73,98.12,61.16,71.8,23.29,19.63,92.64,55.21,17.79,11.04,0,9.82,0.61,0,0.61,6.75,4.29,19.63,9.2,3.68,6.75,0.61,20.86,3.07,2.45,1.23,1.23,1.23,3.68,3.07,0.61,0,0,0,14.72,0,0.61,0,0,9.82,2.45,0.61,1.23,4.29,0,3.68,4.91,2.45,2.45,0,1.23,0,1.23,0,0,18.4,12.27,1.84,1.84,3.07,0.61,4.91,12.27,1.23,17.79,2.45,9.2,6.75,2.45,7.36,0,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.02,3.68,4.29,0,0,0,0.61,1.84,1.23,4.91,2.45,0,0

I will be taking my boyfriend to Paris for our anniversary,On Saturday morning we are travelling to St Pancras in London where we are then getting the Eurostar to Paris. Once in Paris we will go to our hotel called the Sublim Eiffel to check in. I have arranged for a bottle of sparkling wine to be placed in the room. On the first day we are going to visit the Eiffel Tower and I have booked us into the restaurant up the tower for dinner. On Sunday we’ll be going shopping and will visit the sites near to the Arc De Triomphe. Monday’s plans will be to go to the Louvre museum and spend some time walking and taking in the sites.,"Saturday our Eurostar train leaves St Pancras at 07:31 hours and arrives at 10:47 in Paris. 
Paris is a romantic destination therefore is the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary.

Our hotel (Sublim Eiffel) is right outside a metro station for ease of transport getting around the city.

"On Saturday my friend Richard and I will visit York, we're getting there at 11:30 and aiming to return home around 20:00","My friend Richard and I have decided to take a day trip to York on Saturday. We're thinking if get in about 11:30 and aim to leave at 8 that will give us enough time to see a lot of the city. We're going for lunch when we get in, I've heard a popular vegetarian restaurant El Piano is due to close soon so we're going to check that out. Then we're going for a wander - if it's sunny we'll walk the city walls as that's an easy way to take in the sights. We'll be drinking after that though - York has enough bars and pubs to visit a new one every day of the year! We'll probably start on Stonegate, at Evil Eye, as they do amazing cocktails. Then it's just a case of seeing where we fancy - there's no point going with much of a plan as York is very popular for Hen and Stag Do's, so it could be really busy. If we head home about 8 we think we can miss the Saturday night rush at least, and hopefully avoid much of a hangover the next day!",We've booked the 10 o'clock train from Manchester Piccadilly -  we made sure not to book one which went to the coast as it's meant to be sunny and we don't want to have to fight to get on!,uh542648,1279,d,1,230,71.39,88.82,63.33,50.09,25.56,7.83,90.87,54.35,12.61,8.7,1.3,6.96,0,0,0.43,3.91,7.39,17.83,10,6.09,8.26,1.3,22.61,6.09,2.61,1.3,3.04,2.17,5.65,3.48,2.17,0.43,0.43,0.43,10.43,0,0.43,0,0,7.83,1.74,0.43,2.61,2.61,0.87,2.61,3.04,2.61,0.43,0,3.91,0.87,0.43,0,2.61,10.43,7.39,0.43,0,2.17,0.43,2.61,14.78,5.65,20,4.35,7.39,8.26,1.3,3.04,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.65,2.61,2.17,0.43,0,0,1.3,1.74,0,7.39,0,0,0

Going to the Dr. to get my drains out,"Next week, I plan on spending my leisure time FINALLY getting my drains out. They itch like crazy right now. I thought, going in, that they were just going to do my top surgery, bandage me up, and then I'd go in for a couple follow-up check-ups to make sure things were healing alright. But no, I should have known better. Of course with an incision big enough to remove my entire breast on either side, there's going to be some fluid build-up while it's healing. That said, it is definitely not a comfortable thing. 
Right now, I have clear tubing coming from either incision. The tubing leads to these pod-shaped 'bottles' that collect all of the gross fluids from my surgery recovery. I've been using a stretchy ace bandage around my midsection to tuck the drainage containers into so they don't interfere with things. But, despite my best efforts, they still manage to slip around and get loose or shift and dig into my rib-cage. 
Finally, FINALLY, I get to get these things taken out. No more stinging when the tubes get pulled on, no more itching bandaging, no more nausea-inducing emptying of who-knows-what down the sink at the end of every day. All I have to do is show up at the clinic, go back to the office, lay down on the bed, and get this final weight (literally and metaphorically) off/out of my chest.","While I have a different general physician for other unrelated issues, I spent a long time deciding on which surgeon to see for my mastectomy/top surgery. After a lot of research, I decided on Dr. Kimberly Vanderveen in Denver Colorado. I met with her multiple times before the procedure. During these meetings she explained to me exactly what she'd be doing while I was under the anesthesia. She made sure that I knew this would be an irreversible process, and that if I ever decided I wanted my breasts 'back', the only option would be implants. She also let me know that no surgery is perfect - there would be scarring afterwards that would probably never completely fade, and while she would do her best to make sure everything lined up correctly, mistakes happen. By the time I walked out of her office for the last time before going in to get the surgery done, I felt super comfortable with the whole thing. I've been waiting for this for YEARS now - I was so excited the night before my appointment that I barely slept. 
My appointment next week is on Wednesday at 11:00am at my clinic in town. I won't be seeing the same surgeon, obviously, but I've spoken to her on the phone. This is not the first time I've gone in to get my drains out - the first two times they sent me home saying that there was still too much fluid build-up under the skin for it to be safe to remove them. It's going to be so nice to have my freedom back again, even if there are still some bandages left over.",Du717980,1282,d,1,516,59.9,20.24,95.22,78.93,20.64,16.67,90.7,57.95,17.05,11.43,8.53,0,0,1.74,1.16,5.62,5.81,16.28,9.5,6.59,4.46,1.94,19.19,6.2,3.29,0.58,0.97,3.1,4.07,3.49,0.58,0,0,0,4.65,0,0,1.74,0,11.43,1.94,0.97,1.94,1.74,3.29,2.52,2.91,0.97,0.78,1.16,4.65,1.36,3.49,0.39,0.19,6.98,0.19,2.52,2.91,2.71,0.19,5.04,9.5,1.74,21.71,3.1,9.69,9.5,1.55,0,0.39,0.39,0,0,0.19,0,0,0.19,0,0,16.67,5.04,5.43,0.19,0,0,0,2.33,0,2.91,0.39,0.39,0

I'm going to be attending a junior athletics match with my children.,"This weekend, I'll be attending a junior athletics match with my kids. My son has been practicing Taekwondo for a little over two years now, and has gotten quite competitive. This will be his first regional match, so I'm a little nervous about the size and scale of what we'll encounter, but from what I've seen at the local matches it should prove to be an interesting day. 

The matches tend to be broken out into different activities, which evaluate a number of skills. Kids are tested on basic skills (with activities like board breaking), ""forms"" (which are choreographed sequences of attacks), and sparring. At the local match, a winner was picked for each of these. I believe at the regional level, my son will be competing for an overall prize as well.

It may sound strange, but I find these matches are a great way to unwind. My daughter - my youngest child - seems to find the whole thing mesmerizing, so it's a nice way to spend time with her without chasing her, or having to worry about how charged the iPad is. My son really puts his all into these competitions and has a great attitude about it all. It's humbling for me, and really helps me unwind from all of the stress and turmoil of work.","The match is scheduled for this Saturday at 8:00am, at the Thomasville Community Centre. It's being run under the banner of the World Taekwondo Federation. I'm planning to drop off the dog with my brother in law on the way to the event - it's currently summer and if we leave him in the backyard, he'll bark and drive the neighbors mad.",gY917273,1450,d,1,280,81.86,45.73,72.8,31.88,20,17.14,88.93,55,14.29,7.86,5.36,0.71,0,1.79,0,6.43,9.64,16.79,10.71,3.57,5.71,0.36,16.79,3.57,1.43,1.79,1.43,1.79,5.36,2.86,2.5,1.43,0.71,0,6.79,1.79,0.36,1.07,2.86,8.21,2.14,0.71,0.71,2.14,1.43,2.86,0.71,0.36,0.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.29,2.14,3.93,3.57,1.79,0,2.14,12.14,2.5,16.79,2.14,10,4.64,4.29,1.07,1.07,0.36,0,0,0.36,0,0,0,0.36,0,17.5,5,5.36,0.36,0,0,0,1.07,0.71,3.57,1.43,0,0

I have to inspect the rottom timber over the entrance to my porch and decide how to tackle it.,"We've got some old trees that frame the front porch of the house, and I've been worried that they're on their last legs for a while now. I figured this week is as good as any to see how bad it  actually is, and see if I can leave them alone for a while or if I'll have to call someone in to remove them.","There are two really tall trees in the front of the house. I think they're oak trees. We've noticed they aren't quite as lively as they used to be and leaves tend not to grow quite as often. We've also noticed a lot of bugs nesting around some of the branches, which has led to a lot more bugs inside the house.",ob903566,1632,d,1,127,46.87,53.15,83.2,14.82,21.17,6.3,92.91,61.42,14.96,10.24,3.94,2.36,0,0,3.94,4.72,7.87,17.32,12.6,6.3,11.81,1.57,19.69,7.09,4.72,1.57,0.79,4.72,3.94,1.57,2.36,0.79,0,0.79,9.45,0,0,0,0,18.11,3.15,2.36,1.57,9.45,0,5.51,1.57,1.57,0,0,1.57,0.79,0.79,0,0,4.72,2.36,0,0,1.57,0.79,7.09,14.17,0.79,15.75,3.94,6.3,5.51,0,0,3.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13.39,4.72,2.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.3,0,0,0
