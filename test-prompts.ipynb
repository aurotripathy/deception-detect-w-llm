Since it is a work trip, I feel there is less pressure to need to see everything so it will be more of a relaxed experience and I won't be worried if I feel I miss out a few of the activities.

      "My boyfriend is coming to stay for the weekend and we will explore the centre of Paris for 2 days.  Neither of us have been to Paris before.  I have been in the city for only 4 days since Sunday but I am here for work and have not had a chance to look around yet as I have been finishing late in the evenings.  We are staying on the outskirts of the city centre and will use the metro and train system to have a walk around.  We don't have any specific plans but will go to some of the main tourist attractions such as Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower.  We also plan to eat out and I would like to see some of the parks, especially as it is meant to be nice weather.  We are not so interested in seeing museums.  Since it is a work trip, I feel there is less pressure to need to see everything so it will be more of a relaxed experience and I won't be worried if I feel I miss out a few of the activities.  We will also have a go at practising our French with some of the waiters or waitresses!\n",

We have looked into taking the RER B train line to get to the Notre Dame area of the city to the north of where we will stay, and will use the metro to reach the Eiffel Tower which is west of our start point.\n",

He has always wanted to teach me how to play golf and I have always resisted, I think because his golf playing used to annoy my mother when I was a child and I picked up on her negativity.  Now that he has become a widower I want to spend more time with him and have decided that the best way would be to join him in something he loves.  He has given me his old set of golf clubs and on Monday we are going to his golf club at Bawtrey and he is going to give me my first lesson.  I really hope that I enjoy it so that going forward we can both enjoy our 'father and daughter' time.\n",

We also plan to eat out and I would like to see some of the parks, especially as it is meant to be nice weather.  We are not so interested in seeing museums.  Since it is a work trip, I feel there is less pressure to need to see everything so it will be more of a relaxed experience and I won't be worried if I feel I miss out a few of the activities.
