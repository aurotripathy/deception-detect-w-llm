Then we're going for a wander - if it's sunny we'll walk the city walls as that's an easy way to take in the sights. We'll be drinking after that though - York has enough bars and pubs to visit a new one every day of the year! We'll probably start on Stonegate, at Evil Eye, as they do amazing cocktails. Then it's just a case of seeing where we fancy - there's no point going with much of a plan as York is very popular for Hen and Stag Do's, so it could be really busy.
